     <h1> WELCOME TO MY TYPE OF FAMILY </h1>
	 <center><p style="background-color:gray;">This is my type of family I encounter because they share similar values and beliefs as I do,
	 and they make me feel accepted and loved. We have a strong bond and enjoy spending time together, whether it's celebrating holidays or 
	 just hanging out. They understand me and support me through life's ups and downs, and I feel grateful to have them in my life. 
	 We communicate openly and honestly, and we are always there for each other when we need it. This type of family brings me joy and a 
	 sense of belonging, and I cherish the memories we create together.</p></center>
